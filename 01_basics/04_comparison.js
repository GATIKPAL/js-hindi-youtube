//console.log("HELLO");
//console.log(a > b);
//console.log(a < b);
//console.log(a == b);
//console.log(a != b);

console.log("1" > 2);//some time not giverequired results try to compare only same datatype
console.log("02" > 1);

console.log(null > 0);
console.log(null == 0);
console.log(null >= 0);
// in comparison null is converted into zero thats why null>0 is false but null>=0 is true. Comparison and equality check 
//works differently in java script

// === is strict check it check not only values but also its datatypes
